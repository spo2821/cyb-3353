To start the install for the Docker, we need to first open up our Ubuntu Virtual Machine that we created earlier this semester. From here, we will be working to create our Docker install and install OpenVAS.
We'll need to first go into our Ubuntu VM and open up a new terminal instance. From here we'll run the command "sudo apt update" to update our apt installer to ensure that everything is up to date.
From here we will then run "sudo apt install docker.io", this command is what actually installs our docker instance which is what will allow us to complete this lab.
